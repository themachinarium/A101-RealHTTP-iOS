## Why using a custom HTTPClient

When your app is complex and you need to manage different http webservices, or you want to avoid using the shared client to create a decupled implementation, creating a custom `HTTPClient` is the best thing you can do.

With a custom `HTTPClient` you can define your own rules to validate a response coming from a particular webservices, handling all the particular responses and edge cases you can encounter.

This is a custom client:

```swift
public lazy var b2cClient: HTTPClient = {
    var config = URLSessionConfiguration.default
    config.httpShouldSetCookies = true
    config.networkServiceType = .responsiveData
        
    let client = HTTPClient(baseURL: "https://myappb2c.ws.org/api/v2/",configuration: config)

    // Setup some common HTTP Headers for all requests
    client.headers = HTTPHeaders([
        .init(name: .userAgent, value: myAgent),
        .init(name: "X-API-Experimental", value: "true")
    ])
        
    return client
}()
```

It contains a particular `URLSessionConfiguration` and a set of common HTTP Headers which are automatically used by any `HTTPRequest` you run in.

## Validate Responses: Validators

Each raw response from a network call can be validated by a set of objects conform to the `HTTPValidator` object.  

`HTTPClient` instances has a `validators` array which may contains an ordered list of validators which respond to this method:

```swift
func validate(response: HTTPResponse, forRequest request: HTTPRequest) -> HTTPResponseValidatorResult { }
```

This function analyze the response coming from request and decide the next step.  
Particularly you can return:
### Approve the response
`nextValidator`  
The response is okay, you can move to the next validator (if any) or return the response received by the server.  
The `HTTPResponse` is a class where the method are open, so you can alter these values inside the validators if you need.

### Approve with custom response
`nextValidatorWithResponse`  
The response is okay, you can move to the next validator (if any) or return. In this case you can return a new `HTTPResponse` subclass with additional properties.  
This is the case where you must do some additional business logic with your response before sending it outside the library.

### Fail with error

`failChain(Error)`  
Received response is not valid (for example you have an `error` node in your json response which indicates the failure). You can parse the response and return a custom error bypassing the initial response.

### Retry with strategy
`retry(HTTPRetryStrategy)`  
Something bad has occurred; you can however retry if `maxRetries` of the `HTTPRequest` is > 1.  
The options are: 
- `immediate` (will retry the original call immediately)
- `delayed` (will retry the original call after a given amount of seconds), 
- `exponential` and `fibonacci` (same of the `delayed` with different time based upon the attempt made)
- `after(HTTPRequest, TimeInterval, AltRequestCatcher?)` retry the original call after calling an alternate request. For example you are making an authenticated request and session has expired; you can therefore call a login alt request to perform a new login and retry the original call.

We'll take a closer look at these strategies below.

## The Default Validator

Each new client implement a single `validators` object called `HTTPDefaultValidator`.  
This object contains the standard logic to validate a response from server.  
Particularly it:
- Check for empty responses. If you set `allowsEmptyResponses = false` when an empty response has received the chain fail with `HTTPError(.emptyResponse)` error.
- Check the HTTP status code. If the code is an error code the chain may fail *(see the check above)*
- If HTTP status code is an error or underlying `URLSession` received an error code (timeout, connection drop etc.) the `retriableHTTPStatusCodes` map is read. If the error is in that list a new retry may be triggered (only if `maxRetries` of the original `HTTPRequest` > 0).

This validator should never be removed unless you have a really different logic to parse and validate errors.  
Typically you may want to add a new validator after this in order to perform your own logic based upon the uniqueness of your webservice.

## Alt Request Validator

RealHTTP also provide a special validator called `HTTPAltRequestValidator`. This validator can be used when you need to execute a specific `HTTPRequest` if another request fails for certain reason.  

A typical example is the silent login operation; if you receive an `unathorized` or `.forbidden` error for a protected resource you may want to try a silent login operation, then re-execute initial failed request.

The `HTTPAltRequestValidator` is triggered by certain HTTP status code; by default `401/403` and require a callback which return a specific `HTTPRequest` for a certain failed request. 

> **NOTE:** By default this validator is not triggered by network failure. If you want to perform it even when no response is received from server add the `HTTPStatusCode` `.none` to the list of `statusCodes` property.

Usually you may want to be the first validator (before the default one).  
This is an example which perform a 

```swift
let client = HTTPClient(...)
// The alt validator is triggered only when 401 error is received from any request's response.
let authValidator = HTTPAltRequestValidator(statusCodes: [.unauthorized], { request, response in
    // If triggered here you'll specify the alt call to execute in order to refresh a JWT session token
    // before any retry of the initial failed request.
    return HTTPRequest("https://.../refreshToken")
} onReceiveAltResponse: { request, response in
    // Once you have received response from your `refreshToken` call
    // you can do anything you need to use it.
    // In this example we'll set the global client's authorization header.
    let receivedToken = response.data...
    client.headers.set(.authorization, receivedToken)
}

// append at the top of the validators chain
client.validators.insert(authValidator, at: 0)
```

## Custom Validators

When your client has a custom logic to return responses you can create your own validator to ensure all your requests are managed by a single validation code.

Consider a webservices which always return a JSON object with the following keys:
- `code`: `0` if everything is okay, `1` if an error has occurred
- `errorMsg`: the message error, if not `null` something bad occurred
- `data`: a dictionary with the response of the request, must be always present

We can create a custom validator for this logic as seen below:

```swift

import SwiftyJSON

public class MyBadWSValidator: HTTPValidator {
    
    public func validate(response: HTTPResponse, forRequest request: HTTPRequest) -> HTTPResponseValidatorResult {
        // Structure logic check
        guard let data = response.data, let jsonData = JSON(data) else {
            return .failChain(HTTPError(.invalidResponse)) // response must be always JSON, no retry is allowed
        }
        
        guard data["code"].intValue == 0 else {
            let errorMsg = data["errorMsg"].string ?? "Unknown error"
            return .failChain(HTTPError(.internal, errorMsg)) // an error has occurred
        }
        
        // Business logic check
        let isRetriable = data["retriable"].boolValue
        
        guard data["data"].notExist == true, data["data"].type != JSON.Type.dictionary else {
            if isRetriable {
                return .retry(.fibonacci)
            }
            return .failChain(HTTPError(.invalidResponse)) // response must be always JSON, no retry is allowed
        }
        
        return .nextValidator // everything is okay
    }
    
}
```

To add this validator to your client next up the default one just append it to the `validators` property:

```swift
// Configure client
let client = HTTPClient(...)
client.validators.append(MyBadWSValidator())

// Prepare a request
let req = HTTPRequest(...)
req.maxRetries = 3

let result = try await req.fetch(client)
```

Once you set it all the requests executed in this client will be also validated by your own validator.

## Retry After [Another] Call

A particular type of retry strategy is the one call `.after(HTTPRequest, TimeInterval, AltRequestCatcher?)`.  
It allows you to execute an alternate request if your initial fails, then retry the initial again.  

This kind of retry is particularly useful to make a silent login when an authenticated request fails due to expired sessions.

Consider this auth call:

```swift
let usersBooks = HTTPRequest("https://.../user/books/scifi")
userBooks.headers = HTTPHeaders([
    "X-Token": authToken
])
let books = try await usersBooks.fetch()
```

What happend if token is expired? Your call fails with a poor user experience.  
You can make a better experience attempting to refresh the token and retry automatically your call.  
How?

First of all create your own custom validator:

```swift
import SwiftyJSON

public class SilentLoginValidator: HTTPValidator {
    
    /// This is the request which is used to refresh the token
    public var tokenRefreshRequest: HTTPRequest
    
    public func validate(response: HTTPResponse, forRequest request: HTTPRequest) -> HTTPResponseValidatorResult {
        guard response.statusCode == .unauthorized else {
            // If unauthorized error has occurred we'll try to make a silent login and
            // retry the initial request after 0.3 seconds by setting the authorization token,
            let silentLogin: HTTPRetryStrategy = .after(tokenRefreshRequest, 0.3) { request, response in
                if let response = JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: response.data ?? Data(), options: .fragmentsAllowed) as? [String: String] {
                   // Set the new received token
                    request.headers.set("X-Token", response["token"] as! String)
                }
            }
            return .retry(silentLogin)
        }
        
        // No error, move to the next validator
        return .nextValidator
    }
    
}
```

Just set this validator to automatically retry after doing a silent login.
