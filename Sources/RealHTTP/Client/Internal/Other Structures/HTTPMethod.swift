/// Enum to represent a HTTP request method.
/// <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3>
/// In case you need of a custom HTTP Method you can create an extension:
///
/// ```swift
/// extension HTTPMethod {
///   static let custom = HTTPMethod(rawValue: "CUSTOM_METHOD")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - `get`: The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
/// - `head`: The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.
/// - `post`: The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
/// - `put`: The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
/// - `delete`: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
/// - `connect`: The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
/// - `trace`: The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
/// - `options`: The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
/// - `patch`: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
